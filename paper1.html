                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <p>This paper proposes entitymetrics to measure the impact of knowledge units.
                            Entitymetrics highlight the importance of entities embedded in scientific
                            literature for further knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use Metformin,
                            a drug for diabetes, as an example to form an entity-entity citation network
                            based on literature related to Metformin. We then calculate the network
                            features and compare the centrality ranks of biological entities with results
                            from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). The comparison demonstrates
                            the usefulness of entitymetrics to detect most of the outstanding interactions
                            manually curated in CTD.

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Currently, knowledge is being amassed rapidly; however, most of it is being
                            encoded as strings in unstructured scientific literature. Extraction of this
                            knowledge presently places a huge burden on already overloaded researchers,
                            as they must manually dig out the embedded knowledge by reading tons of
                            articles. This knowledge consists of many connected individual knowledge
                            units encapsulated as entities in scientific papers. These entities could
                            be authors, references, journals, and keywords that are commonly studied in
                            scholarly evaluation, or they could be datasets, key methods, genes, drugs,
                            and diseases that have not yet been widely explored in bibliometrics.
                            Effective knowledge transfer depends on efficient knowledge accumulation.
                            If these entities were decoded/annotated using a standard format (e.g.
                            XML tags or RDF triples) and following shared semantics (e.g., domain
                            ontologies, or controlled vocabularies), then connecting the entity dots
                            would be as easy as flipping a switch. A knowledge graph could then be
                            formed/accumulated automatically based on existing articles, and newly
                            published articles, to lead potentially to successful knowledge discovery [1].

                        <h2>Methodology</h2>
                        <p>Metformin (N",N"-dimethylbiguanide) is often referred to as a magic drug.
                            Originally, the drug was developed to treat Type II diabetes, however now,
                            it is also being considered to treat and prevent cancer, obesity, depression,
                            and aging [16]. Endocrinologists, cardiologists, oncologists, and aging
                            specialists have generated waves of interest by attempting to use
                            anti-diabetic biguanides to control body weight and tumor growth [48].
                            Metformin is the only anti-diabetic drug, which can prevent the
                            cardiovascular complications of diabetes and remains as one, of the only two,
                            oral anti-diabetics on the World Health Organization Model List of Essential
                            Medicines [49]. Obesity and cancer have interrelationships with aging [50].
                            Metformin is able moderately to reduce body weight for obese diabetics because
                            it can reduce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [51]. A recent study
                            found that children and adolescents are more responsive to metformin-induced
                            weight loss compared to adults [52].

                            It refines Swanson's method by utilizing B terms as knowledge entities.
